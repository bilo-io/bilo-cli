# Bilo-CLI

This is a repo containing scripts to automate various tasks for NodeJS projects.
These tasks have all been combined into a *CLI* (command line interface), called `bilo`.

>- Currently, there is only the functionality to create frontend projects
>- An item has been created for initialising server projects as well

## Quickstart

You can install the CLI on Windows & Linux based machines as follows:

**MacOS/Linux** (`bash`)
- `git clone https://github.com/bilo-io/bilo-cli`
- `cd ./bilo-cli`
- `bash ./.shell/install-bilo-cli.sh`

> Optional: You give this cli an alias as too (e.g. with the alias `my-cli`)
> e.g. `bash ./.shell/install-bilo-cli.sh my-cli`
> by default, the `cli` is called `bilo`

**Windows** (`powershell`)
> TODO: still need to create the `install-bilo-cli.ps1` script

## Usage

The CLI can be used to create NodeJS applications, where you can add Express, Webpack, React & Angular.
Below is an example for how to create a webapplication in a newly created, empty folder.

>NOTE: This actual `cli` still needs to be created, but the underlying functionality is already in place.
- `mkdir ExampleApp`
- `cd ./ExampleApp`
- `bilo` OR `bilo -h` OR `bilo -help`
    - shows all commands available in the cli
- `bilo init-app`
    - this will add a the `src` in the root folder, as well as create an `npm package`
- `bilo init-webpack`
    - this will add `webpack` to and create a `webpack.config.js` in your project root
- `bilo build`

## CLI Commands

Below is a full list of commands provided by the `bilo` CLI.


|Command|Flags|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|`bilo`|`-h` OR `-help`|shows help page|

||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|`build`|N/A|builds a production package using webpack|
|`clean`|N/A|cleans the directory, removing all generated folders, while leaving `src` and required files untouched|
|`deploy`|N/A|deploys the generated `artifact` to a local directory, simulating the prod environment|


## Features
There is a variant of each script for **powershell** (`.ps1`) and **bash** (`.sh`).
The table below lists these scripts and their effects.

|Script|Function|
|:-----|:-------|
|`build`|builds an artifact from `src` folder, using webpack... output directory is `./artifact`)|
|`clean`|deletes folders generated by webapp (`node_modules`, `dist` & `artifact`)|
|`deploy`|simulates a  web deployment on your local machine - _(useful to test before production)_|
|`init-webapp`|creates a basic webapp with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)|
|`init-webpack`|adds webpack to an existing NodeJS application|
|`init-react`|creates a bare bones [ReactJS]() application, based on top of an existing node webapp (pre-requisite: run `init-webapp`|
|`init-express`|adds [Express](https://expressjs.com/) & `express-history-api-fallback` to an existing NodeJS application|

## Background

This is a quick re-cap of what [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) & [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) are, and what problems they solve.
